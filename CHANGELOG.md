# Changelog

## 0.2.0

First standalone release. Renamed from `glm53_exl3_plugin` 0.1.1 — identical
behavior plus the package rename; the old import path remains as a
deprecated shim.

## 0.1.1 (as glm53_exl3_plugin, shipped in the GLM recipe)

- Raise the fused-MoE per-expert row cap (`TEMP_ROWS_FUSED` 128 → 2048),
  fixing the >163k-token prefill stall where fat experts fell back to a
  slow per-expert reconstruction path.
- Delegate non-routed layers to a pack-declared source-format quant method
  (`quantization_config.non_routed_quantization`).

## 0.1.0 (as glm53_exl3_plugin)

Initial in-recipe release: EXL3/MCG routed-expert quantization method for
vLLM fork runtimes, per-layer `layer_bits` support.
